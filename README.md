LPP indicates that Loot++ is required for this addon.

The 1.7.10 LBO Addons are the special "Add-On packs" I designed for 1.7.10 mod support, and are not required if you use JUST the 1.7.10 blocks.

The 1.8 OMEGA Arena is a map showcasing some of the OMEGA Bosses, set up for "Challenge Games" popularized by PopularMMOs on YouTube.

The 1.8 LPP OMEGA Tools Addon are for those that use Loot++ but don't want to use Lucky Block OMEGA - It's simply a Creative Mode tab with the major OMEGA additions.
