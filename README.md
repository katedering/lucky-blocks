The 1.7.10 LBO Addons are the special "Add-On packs" I designed for 1.7.10 mod support, and are not required if you use JUST the 1.7.10 blocks.

The 1.8 OMEGA Arena is a map showcasing some of the OMEGA Bosses, set up for "Challenge Games" popularized by PopularMMOs on YouTube.

The 1.8 LPP OMEGA Tools Addon are for those that use Loot++ but don't want to use Lucky Block OMEGA - It's simply a Creative Mode tab with the major OMEGA additions.

The 1.8 LPP Lucky Block OMEGA is a Loot++ addon for those that DO use Lucky Block OMEGA as it include some of the blocks themselves. Using this one without the Lucky Block itself will cause errors.
